    09.66 | The club isn't the best place to find a lover
    12.16 | So the bar is where I go
    14.91 | Me and my friends at the table doing shots
    17.17 | Drinking faster and then we talk slow
    19.92 | Come over and start up a conversation with just me
    22.41 | And trust me I'll give it a chance now
    24.92 | Take my hand, stop
    26.16 | Put Van The Man on the jukebox
    27.16 | And then we start to dance
    28.41 | And now I'm singing like
    29.91 | Girl, you know I want your love
    32.16 | Your love was handmade for somebody like me
    35.41 | Come on now, follow my lead
    37.17 | I may be crazy, don't mind me
    39.66 | Say, boy, let's not talk too much
    42.41 | Grab on my waist and put that body on me
    45.41 | Come on now, follow my lead
    47.16 | Come, come on now, follow my lead
    50.91 | I'm in love with the shape of you
    53.41 | We push and pull like a magnet do
    55.66 | Although my heart is falling too
    58.16 | I'm in love with your body
    60.67 | And last night you were in my room
    63.16 | And now my bedsheets smell like you
    65.41 | Every day discovering something brand new
    68.17 | I'm in love with your body
    69.91 | Oh I oh I oh I oh I
    73.41 | I'm in love with your body
    74.91 | Oh I oh I oh I oh I
    78.42 | I'm in love with your body
    79.91 | Oh I oh I oh I oh I
    83.17 | I'm in love with your body
    85.42 | Every day discovering something brand new
    88.16 | I'm in love with the shape of you
    89.91 | One week in we let the story begin
    91.91 | We're going out on our first date
    94.92 | You and me are thrifty
    96.05 | So go all you can eat
    97.05 | Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
    99.77 | We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
    102.27 | And how your family is doing okay
    104.77 | Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
    107.52 | Tell the driver make the radio play
    109.27 | And I'm singing like
    110.17 | Girl, you know I want your love
    112.18 | Your love was handmade for somebody like me
    115.42 | Come on now, follow my lead
    117.17 | I may be crazy, don't mind me
    119.92 | Say, boy, let's not talk too much
    122.17 | Grab on my waist and put that body on me
    125.17 | Come on now, follow my lead
    126.92 | Come, come on now, follow my lead
    130.67 | I'm in love with the shape of you
    133.42 | We push and pull like a magnet do
    135.67 | Although my heart is falling too
    138.17 | I'm in love with your body
    140.67 | And last night you were in my room
    143.42 | And now my bedsheets smell like you
